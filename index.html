            <h2>About Linus Torvalds</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Linus Benedict Torvalds (born December 28, 1969) is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the
                creator and, historically, the principal developer of the Linux kernel, which became the kernel for many
                Linux distributions and operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed
                version control system Git and the diving logging and planning software Subsurface. He has been honored
                with various awards for his contributions to computing, including the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize
                from the Technology Academy Finland.</li>
                <li>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds, a member of
                the European Parliament. He is a Swedish-speaking Finn and holds dual Finnish and American citizenship.
                He attended the University of Helsinki from 1988 to 1996, graduating with a master's degree in computer
                science. During this time, he developed an interest in computer operating systems, and worked on several
                small projects.</li>
                <li>In 1991, Torvalds began working on a new operating system kernel, which he initially called "Freax". He
                later renamed it Linux, a combination of his first name and the word "Unix". The first version of the
                Linux kernel was released in September 1991, and it quickly gained popularity among programmers and
                computer enthusiasts. Torvalds continued to develop and improve the kernel, releasing new versions
                regularly.</li>
                <li>In addition to his work on the Linux kernel, Torvalds has also been involved in the development of other
                software projects. In 2005, he created Git, a distributed version control system that is widely used in
                software development. He has also worked on Subsurface, a diving logging and planning software.</li>
                <li>Torvalds has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to computing. In 2012, he was
                awarded the Millennium Technology Prize, which is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the
                field of technology. He has also been inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame and the Computer History
                Museum.</li>
                <li>Despite his success, Torvalds is known for his outspoken and sometimes controversial personality. He has
                been criticized for his harsh language and behavior towards other developers, and has been involved in
                several public disputes. However, he remains a highly respected figure in the tech community, and his
                contributions to the field of computing have had a significant impact on the industry.</li>
                <li>In recent years, Torvalds has focused on improving the Linux kernel and addressing issues related to
                security and performance. He continues to be an active developer and is involved in the open-source
                community. Torvalds' work has helped to shape the modern computing landscape, and his contributions will
                continue to be felt for years to come.</li>
